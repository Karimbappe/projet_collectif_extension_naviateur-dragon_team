Chrome extension project : "On air Today" ðŸ“º

This Chrome extension was created by:

Juanita AFANADOR KOWALSKI </br>
Karim FRABOULET </br>
Faris MEBARAKOU

As its name implies, this extension lets the user know the USA tv schedule of the day. We added the possibility to see the schedule of the day before and the day after.

We created the extension as a school project at Ada Tech School in Paris, France. 


We choosed to make this extension because when we started the project we realised there wasn't any existing one that satisfied our criteria. 
So... why dont't make it ourselves? 

Hope you like it.
